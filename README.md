# Hi, I'm Lucas 👋
**Data Science & AI student** | Aspiring Data Engineer | Passionate about turning data into real-world impact

## 🚀 About Me  
I'm a Data Science & AI student with a strong interest in **data engineering, cloud, and building scalable data workflows**.  
I enjoy working on systems where data moves from raw collection to actionable insights: pipelines, APIs, dashboards, and everything in between.
In my most recent project, I designed and built an automated data integration system that ingests data from **cameras, EEG devices, and wearables**, stores it in **PostgreSQL**, and exposes it through dashboards for stakeholders.  
This taught me not only the technical skills but also how crucial it is to make data **usable** for people.
